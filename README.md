# Objectives

The primary objective of this SQL project is to analyze a Spotify dataset by leveraging advanced SQL techniques to derive meaningful insights. The project involves normalizing a denormalized dataset to ensure data integrity and optimize performance. It focuses on executing SQL queries of varying complexity, ranging from simple aggregations to advanced queries, such as using window functions, subqueries, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs). Key tasks include analyzing track attributes such as danceability, energy, and tempo, identifying popular tracks, albums, and artists based on views, streams, likes, and comments, and performing attribute-specific analyses to gain deeper insights. Additionally, the project aims to enhance query performance and efficiency while exploring advanced SQL skills to extract actionable insights from the dataset.


# Project Steps

1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:

Artist: The performer of the track.

Track: The name of the song.

Album: The album to which the track belongs.

Album_type: The type of album (e.g., single or album).

Various metrics such as danceability, energy, loudness, tempo, and more.

4. Querying the Data
   
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into easy, medium, and advanced levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

Easy Queries

Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.

Medium Queries

More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.

Advanced Queries

Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.

5. Query Optimization
   
In advanced stages, the focus shifts to improving query performance. Some optimization strategies include:

Indexing: Adding indexes on frequently queried columns.

Query Execution Plan: Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE to review and refine query performance.
